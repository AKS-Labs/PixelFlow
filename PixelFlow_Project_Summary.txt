# PixelFlow Project Summary

## Project Overview
PixelFlow is an Android app designed to enhance screenshot management by automatically detecting screenshots, creating draggable floating bubbles with screenshot thumbnails, and allowing users to organize screenshots into customizable folders displayed as circular zones in a semi-circular pattern.

## Key Features
1. Screenshot detection in the background
2. Circular floating bubbles with screenshot thumbnails
3. Customizable folder organization
4. Material Design 3 styling
5. Drag-and-drop interface with visual feedback

## Development Timeline

### Initial Concept and Setup
- Created the initial concept for an app that detects screenshots and displays them as floating bubbles
- Established requirements: detect screenshots, create draggable floating bubbles, organize into folders
- Set up the GitHub repository at https://github.com/AKS-Labs/PixelFlow.git
- Decided to use 'main' branch instead of 'master' for version control

### Core Functionality Implementation
- Implemented screenshot detection service that runs in the background
- Created floating bubble UI with CardView for circular appearance
- Developed drag-and-drop functionality for organizing screenshots
- Implemented folder management system with customizable folders
- Added vibration feedback when screenshots are dropped into folders
- Ensured the service runs continuously in the background, even when the app is closed

### UI Design and Enhancement
- Designed the app with Material Design 3 styling
- Created circular drag zones for folder targets
- Implemented animations for dragging and dropping
- Added visual feedback for user interactions
- Designed the app logo and branding

### UI Refinements
1. **Floating Bubble Improvements**:
   - Made the floating bubble perfectly circular
   - Increased size to 90dp (from 80dp)
   - Added 5dp growth animation when dragged
   - Ensured the bubble maintains its circular shape during dragging
   - Added elevation effects for a 3D "lifted" appearance
   - Positioned the bubble on the right side near volume keys for easy access

2. **Drag Zone Enhancements**:
   - Created flower/gear-shaped drag zones with soft, wavy edges
   - Used Material Design 3 colors for visual appeal
   - Made drag zones solid white with 100% opacity
   - Increased default size by 10dp
   - Added 10dp additional growth when a bubble hovers over a zone
   - Implemented magnetic attraction to make dragging more intuitive
   - Added shadow effects, highlight rings, and pulse animations

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed permission handling for screenshot detection
- Improved service reliability for continuous background operation
- Enhanced performance for smooth animations
- Implemented proper error handling and logging
- Added vibration feedback for better user experience

### Architecture and Code Quality
- Initially used a mix of XML layouts and Jetpack Compose
- Created a migration plan to move to 100% Jetpack Compose and 0% XML
- Designed a clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Implemented proper state management
- Used coroutines for asynchronous operations

## Special Requirements
- Created a specific 'PixelFlow' folder in the file manager with subfolders (Tricks, Quotes, etc.)
- Made the floating bubble circular and positioned it on the right side near volume keys
- Added permission status display on the home screen
- Implemented size animations for the floating bubble
- Ensured drag zones are fully visible on screen
- Added vibration feedback when screenshots are dropped
- Handled original screenshots rather than creating copies

## Technical Challenges Overcome
- Ensuring reliable screenshot detection in the background
- Creating perfectly circular UI elements that maintain their shape during animations
- Implementing complex custom views with flower/gear shapes
- Managing window overlays and system permissions
- Handling touch events and drag-and-drop functionality
- Migrating from XML to Jetpack Compose

## Future Directions
- Complete migration to 100% Jetpack Compose
- Add more customization options for folders and bubbles
- Implement cloud backup for screenshots
- Add sharing functionality
- Enhance the UI with more Material Design 3 components
- Optimize performance for older devices

## Design Philosophy
- Focus on Material Design 3 for a modern, cohesive look
- Prioritize intuitive user experience with visual feedback
- Create a playful yet functional interface
- Use system colors and themes for a native feel
- Implement smooth animations for a polished experience

This project demonstrates advanced Android development techniques including custom views, services, background processing, drag-and-drop interfaces, and Material Design implementation, all while maintaining a focus on user experience and visual appeal.
